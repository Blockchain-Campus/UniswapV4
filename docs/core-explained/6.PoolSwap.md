# Pool Swap

In the previous section, we provided an overview of the entire swap process, but we have not yet analyzed how `pool.swap(params)` is actually executed. Now, let's dive into `src/libraries/Pool.sol` to understand how token swaps occur within the contract.

```solidity
struct SwapParams {
    int256 amountSpecified;
    int24 tickSpacing;
    bool zeroForOne;
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96;
    uint24 lpFeeOverride;
}

function swap(State storage self, SwapParams memory params)
        internal
        returns (BalanceDelta swapDelta, uint256 amountToProtocol, uint24 swapFee, SwapResult memory result)
    {
```

As seen in the code above, the `swap` function's input data structure is `SwapParams`. Let's analyze the role of each parameter in `SwapParams`. The `amountSpecified` parameter represents the exact amount of tokens the user wants to send to or receive from the pool.

`tickSpacing` determines the intervals at which ticks are searched (for example, 1, 10, or 20). Ticks can only be searched at increments defined by `tickSpacing`. Smaller `tickSpacing` values provide greater liquidity to complete the swap, resulting in more accurate transactions and reduced slippage. However, this comes at the cost of higher gas fees due to more extensive tick searches. 

It represents a trade-off between lower accuracy and higher slippage with reduced gas costs, or higher accuracy and lower slippage with increased gas costs.

`zeroForOne` indicates whether `token0` is being swapped for `token1` or the reverse.  

`sqrtPriceLimitX96` serves as price range protection, ensuring that swaps occur within a specified limit. This mechanism prevents slippage from exceeding the user's maximum allowable threshold.

`lpFeeOverride` works in conjunction with hooks to enable dynamic fees for swaps. If the hook overrides the liquidity provider (LP) fee before the swap is executed, the swap uses the overridden fee. Otherwise, the default swap fee is applied.

Now, let's take a closer look at the execution of the `swap` function.

```solidity
int256 amountSpecifiedRemaining = params.amountSpecified;
int256 amountCalculated = 0;
// initialize to the current sqrt(price)
result.sqrtPriceX96 = slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96();
// initialize to the current tick
result.tick = slot0Start.tick();
// initialize to the current liquidity
result.liquidity = self.liquidity;
```

The following code sets up the initial state for the swap. The `amountSpecifiedRemaining` variable is initialized based on the amount of tokens the user wishes to swap. 

Why do we use "remaining" to name this variable? This is because the liquidity at a given tick may not fully satisfy the user's swap request. In such cases, the swap process continues searching for liquidity at the next tick. Therefore, we need a parameter to track the number of tokens that still need to be swapped during this process.

To complement `amountSpecifiedRemaining`, the `amountCalculated` variable represents the tokens already obtained from the swap. Its initial value is set to 0.

```solidity
uint24 lpFee = params.lpFeeOverride.isOverride()
                ? params.lpFeeOverride.removeOverrideFlagAndValidate()
                : slot0Start.lpFee();

swapFee = protocolFee == 0 ? lpFee : uint16(protocolFee).calculateSwapFee(lpFee);
```

`lpFee` represents the fee paid to the liquidity provider. As mentioned earlier in the `lpFeeOverride` parameter explanation, if the hook adjusts this value, the fee provided by the hook is used as the LP fee. Otherwise, the default fee is applied.

`swapFee` represents the total fee, which combines the protocol fee and the liquidity provider fee for this swap. The calculation of the total fee is as follows:

```solidity
// protocolFee + lpFee(1_000_000 - protocolFee) / 1_000_000 (rounded up)
```

From the calculation method, we can see that the final fee is not simply the sum of `protocolFee` and `lpFee`. Instead, the swapping tokens are first charged the `protocolFee`, and the remaining tokens are then subject to the `lpFee`.

```solidity
if (zeroForOne) {
    if (params.sqrtPriceLimitX96 >= slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96()) {
        PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded.selector.revertWith(slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96(), params.sqrtPriceLimitX96);
    }
    // Swaps can never occur at MIN_TICK, only at MIN_TICK + 1, except at initialization of a pool
    // Under certain circumstances outlined below, the tick will preemptively reach MIN_TICK without swapping there
    if (params.sqrtPriceLimitX96 <= TickMath.MIN_SQRT_PRICE) {
        PriceLimitOutOfBounds.selector.revertWith(params.sqrtPriceLimitX96);
    }
} else {
    if (params.sqrtPriceLimitX96 <= slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96()) {
        PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded.selector.revertWith(slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96(), params.sqrtPriceLimitX96);
    }
    if (params.sqrtPriceLimitX96 >= TickMath.MAX_SQRT_PRICE) {
        PriceLimitOutOfBounds.selector.revertWith(params.sqrtPriceLimitX96);
    }
}
```

If `zeroForOne` is true, it indicates that the user wants to swap `token0` for `token1`. In this case, the price curve will decline during the swap. However, if `params.sqrtPriceLimitX96 >= slot0Start.sqrtPriceX96()`, it means the user's minimum swap price limit is higher than the current price. As a result, the swap will not proceed.

Similarly, if `zeroForOne` is false, the user intends to swap `token1` for `token0`, causing the price curve to rise during the swap. In this scenario, the limit swap price `params.sqrtPriceLimitX96` must be higher than the current price; otherwise, the swap will fail.

```solidity
StepComputations memory step;
step.feeGrowthGlobalX128 = zeroForOne ? self.feeGrowthGlobal0X128 : self.feeGrowthGlobal1X128;

while (!(amountSpecifiedRemaining == 0 || result.sqrtPriceX96 == params.sqrtPriceLimitX96)) 
{...}
```

Next, we initialize the variable `feeGrowthGlobalX128` to facilitate the accumulation of LP fees. In the following part, we will dive into the while loop to explore how tick liquidity is searched and how the swap is executed.

```solidity
// Inside the while loop
(step.tickNext, step.initialized) =
self.tickBitmap.nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord(result.tick, params.tickSpacing, zeroForOne);

if (step.tickNext <= TickMath.MIN_TICK) {
    step.tickNext = TickMath.MIN_TICK;
}
if (step.tickNext >= TickMath.MAX_TICK) {
    step.tickNext = TickMath.MAX_TICK;
}
step.sqrtPriceNextX96 = TickMath.getSqrtPriceAtTick(step.tickNext);
```

The `nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord` function returns the `tickNext` as an `int24` value, representing the next initialized tick position (within the range of [`TickMath.MIN_TICK`, `TickMath.MAX_TICK`]). It also checks if the tick has liquidity, which is indicated by the `initialized` variable. 

This function searches for ticks within the boundaries of one word in the tick bitmap. For the `zeroForOne` price direction, it can search up to 256 ticks. However, the search is constrained to the current bitmap. If no liquidity is found within the current bitmap, the function returns either the leftmost or rightmost tick of the bitmap, setting `initialized` to `false` to indicate that no liquidity exists at the returned tick.

You might wonderâ€”what happens if `tickSpacing` exceeds 256? Wouldn't this prevent the function from locating the next tick within one word? This is not an issue. The `compress` function addresses cases where `tickSpacing` exceeds 256 by compressing the tick value. This allows efficient tick searches even when the spacing surpasses the 256-tick boundary.

```solidity
// src/libraries/TickBitmap/nextInitializedTickWithinOneWord
int24 compressed = compress(tick, tickSpacing);

function compress(int24 tick, int24 tickSpacing) internal pure returns (int24 compressed) {
    // compressed = tick / tickSpacing;
    // if (tick < 0 && tick % tickSpacing != 0) compressed--;
    assembly ("memory-safe") {
        tick := signextend(2, tick)
        tickSpacing := signextend(2, tickSpacing)
        compressed :=
            sub(
                sdiv(tick, tickSpacing),
                // if (tick < 0 && tick % tickSpacing != 0) then tick % tickSpacing < 0, vice versa
                slt(smod(tick, tickSpacing), 0)
            )
    }
}
```

The value stored in the tick bitmap is not the raw tick position but rather the result of dividing the tick by `tickSpacing` using the formula `tick / tickSpacing`. This process discards any remainder, retaining only the integer portion of the result.

The compressed structure allows efficient searching within the bitmap. The reason for handling negative compressed values separately is due to Solidity's behavior in integer division. By default, negative division rounds towards zero, but in this context, we need the result to round away from zero. As a result, when `tick % tickSpacing != 0`, the compressed value is decremented by 1 to account for this behavior.

```solidity
(result.sqrtPriceX96, step.amountIn, step.amountOut, step.feeAmount) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep(
    result.sqrtPriceX96, // current price
    SwapMath.getSqrtPriceTarget(zeroForOne, step.sqrtPriceNextX96, params.sqrtPriceLimitX96),
    result.liquidity, // current liquidity
    amountSpecifiedRemaining,
    swapFee
);

// sqrtPriceX96: the new price after this swap
// step.amountIn: the amount of input tokens for this step
// step.amountOut: the amount of output tokens for this step
// feeAmount: the fee charged for this step
```

The role of the `SwapMath.computeSwapStep` function is to calculate the token amount that can be swapped from the current tick to the next tick. If the liquidity at the current tick is insufficient to complete the swap, the function records the amount of tokens already swapped. The remaining tokens are processed in the next iteration of the while loop.

```solidity
// if exactOutput
if (params.amountSpecified > 0) {
    unchecked {
        amountSpecifiedRemaining -= step.amountOut.toInt256();
    }
    amountCalculated -= (step.amountIn + step.feeAmount).toInt256();
} else {
    // safe because we test that amountSpecified > amountIn + feeAmount in SwapMath
    unchecked {
        amountSpecifiedRemaining += (step.amountIn + step.feeAmount).toInt256();
    }
    amountCalculated += step.amountOut.toInt256();
}
```

`params.amountSpecified > 0` represents an exact output swap, meaning the user specifies the exact amount of tokens they want to receive. In this scenario, the amount of tokens to be received is fixed, so `amountCalculated` represents the amount of tokens the user needs to send to the pool. A negative value indicates that the pool receives tokens from the user, which is why we use `-=`. Conversely, a positive value represents tokens that need to be sent to the user, and `amountSpecifiedRemaining` tracks the remaining amount that needs to be sent. Each loop iteration reduces `amountSpecifiedRemaining` by the corresponding output amount, until `amountSpecifiedRemaining == 0`.

In contrast, when `params.amountSpecified < 0`, it represents an exact input swap, meaning the user specifies the exact amount of tokens they want to provide to the pool. In this case, `amountCalculated` represents the amount of tokens the pool will return to the user. A positive value of `amountCalculated` indicates the tokens the user will receive, which is why we use `+=`. 

`amountSpecifiedRemaining` tracks the amount of tokens the user still needs to provide to the pool. Since the user is supplying tokens, `amountSpecifiedRemaining` is negative. Each loop iteration reduces this negative value by adding the input amount, gradually approaching zero until `amountSpecifiedRemaining == 0`.

To summarize:  

- In exact output swaps (`params.amountSpecified > 0`), the user specifies the exact amount of tokens they wish to receive, and the pool calculates how many tokens the user must provide.

- In exact input swaps (`params.amountSpecified < 0`), the user provides a fixed amount of tokens to the pool, and the pool calculates how many tokens to return.  

```solidity
if (protocolFee > 0) {
    unchecked {
        uint256 delta = (swapFee == protocolFee)
            ? step.feeAmount // lp fee is 0, so the entire fee is owed to the protocol instead
            : (step.amountIn + step.feeAmount) * protocolFee / ProtocolFeeLibrary.PIPS_DENOMINATOR;
        step.feeAmount -= delta;
        amountToProtocol += delta;
    }
}
```

From the above code, we can see that when `protocolFee` is enabled, the protocol fee is calculated as a ratio of the original input tokens. The user's input tokens are split into `amountIn` and `feeAmount`, where only `amountIn` is added to the pool for the swap. The `feeAmount` is deducted from the input tokens before the swap occurs.

```solidity
if (result.liquidity > 0) {
    unchecked {
        // FullMath.mulDiv isn't needed as the numerator can't overflow uint256 since tokens have a max supply of type(uint128).max
        step.feeGrowthGlobalX128 +=
            UnsafeMath.simpleMulDiv(step.feeAmount, FixedPoint128.Q128, result.liquidity);
    }
}
```

When the current tick has liquidity, the swap fee for this step needs to be added to the global fee amounts. This is done using the formula `feeGrowthGlobalX128 += feeAmount * Q128 / liquidity`, which accumulates the global fee. 

Why do we divide by liquidity instead of simply adding `feeAmount`? The reason is to normalize the global fee per unit of liquidity. This allows LPs (Liquidity Providers) to calculate their share of fees in the future by simply multiplying their liquidity by the accumulated global fee.

```solidity
feesOwed = (feeGrowthInside - feeGrowthInsideLastX128) * liquidity / Q128
```

Another question is whether the user swaps `token0` for `token1` or `token1` for `token0`. Since the `feeAmount` could be in either `token0` or `token1`, how do we ensure that the accumulated fees are correctly attributed to the respective token? 

This is handled in the previous code snippet, where `step.feeGrowthGlobalX128` is assigned using `zeroForOne ? self.feeGrowthGlobal0X128 : self.feeGrowthGlobal1X128`. This determines whether the global fee corresponds to `token0` or `token1`. Additionally, conditional checks in subsequent code ensure that the data is saved in the correct position.

```solidity
// update fee growth global
if (!zeroForOne) {
    self.feeGrowthGlobal1X128 = step.feeGrowthGlobalX128;
} else {
    self.feeGrowthGlobal0X128 = step.feeGrowthGlobalX128;
}
```

Now, let's take a look at when the tick price float to next tick postion then what will happen.

```solidity
if (result.sqrtPriceX96 == step.sqrtPriceNextX96) {
    // if the tick is initialized, run the tick transition
    if (step.initialized) {
        (uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128, uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128) = zeroForOne
            ? (step.feeGrowthGlobalX128, self.feeGrowthGlobal1X128)
            : (self.feeGrowthGlobal0X128, step.feeGrowthGlobalX128);
        int128 liquidityNet =
            Pool.crossTick(self, step.tickNext, feeGrowthGlobal0X128, feeGrowthGlobal1X128);
        // if we're moving leftward, we interpret liquidityNet as the opposite sign
        // safe because liquidityNet cannot be type(int128).min
        unchecked {
            if (zeroForOne) liquidityNet = -liquidityNet;
        }

        result.liquidity = LiquidityMath.addDelta(result.liquidity, liquidityNet);
    }

    unchecked {
        result.tick = zeroForOne ? step.tickNext - 1 : step.tickNext;
    }
}

function crossTick(State storage self, int24 tick, uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128, uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128)
    internal
    returns (int128 liquidityNet)
{
		...
    liquidityNet = info.liquidityNet;
}
```

If zeroForOne is true, it means the user swaps token0 for token1. Before the actual swap occurs, the contract first takes some tokens as a fee. Therefore, we should accumulate and update the token0 fees. The token1 fees won't change, so we don't need to update them. Conversely, the analysis is likely to follow this framework.

If the next tick (boundary tick) has liquidity, the `crossTick` function is invoked to process the tick transition (`crossTick` role is to update the new tick's `tickInfo` because beforehand the global fees have growth). When `zeroForOne` is true, it indicates that the swap price increases (i.e., the price curve moves from right to left). In this case, crossing a tick means the liquidity associated with the previous tick should be removed. 

When using the `upperTick` method to return `liquidityNet` , **the logic assumes the price is moving from left to right**. However, since the price is moving from right to left in this scenario, a negative value is added to `liquidityNet` to account for the directional difference.

The sign of `liquidityNet` is just a convention and doesnâ€™t have an actual meaning. When the price moves from left to right, the `liquidityNet` sign is positive; otherwise, it is negative.

When `zeroForOne` is true, why do we need to use `tickNext - 1`? The reason lies in how tick liquidity is applied. For a price range moving from left to right, the active tick range is `[tick, tick + 1]`. However, when the price moves from right to left, the active tick range becomes `[tick - 1, tick]`. Therefore, when `zeroForOne` is true, we adjust the tick to `tickNext - 1` to reflect the correct price range.

```solidity
else if (result.sqrtPriceX96 != step.sqrtPriceStartX96) {
    // recompute unless we're on a lower tick boundary (i.e. already transitioned ticks), and haven't moved
    result.tick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtPrice(result.sqrtPriceX96);
}
```

Another scenario occurs when the price changes but does not reach the next price tick. In this case, the `getTickAtSqrtPrice` function is used to calculate the current tick corresponding to the updated square root price.

```solidity
self.slot0 = slot0Start.setTick(result.tick).setSqrtPriceX96(result.sqrtPriceX96);
// update liquidity if it changed
if (self.liquidity != result.liquidity) self.liquidity = result.liquidity;

// update fee growth global
if (!zeroForOne) {
    self.feeGrowthGlobal1X128 = step.feeGrowthGlobalX128;
} else {
    self.feeGrowthGlobal0X128 = step.feeGrowthGlobalX128;
}
```

Next, the contract state is updated with the latest tick, price, and liquidity information.

Finally, the final swap result, `swapDelta`, is calculated as follows:

```solidity
if (zeroForOne != (params.amountSpecified < 0)) {
    swapDelta = toBalanceDelta(
        amountCalculated.toInt128(), (params.amountSpecified - amountSpecifiedRemaining).toInt128()
    );
} else {
    swapDelta = toBalanceDelta(
        (params.amountSpecified - amountSpecifiedRemaining).toInt128(), amountCalculated.toInt128()
    );
}
```

There are two cases to consider: 

1. The swap is accurate for `token1`. This happens when the user swaps `token0` for `token1` with an exact output (`zeroForOne == true && params.amountSpecified > 0`), or when the user swaps `token1` for `token0` with an exact input (`zeroForOne == false && params.amountSpecified < 0`).

2. The swap is accurate for `token0`. The logic here is similar but applies to the opposite direction of the swap.
