# Pool Swap

In the previous section, we provided an overview of the entire swap process, but we have not yet analyzed how `pool.swap(params)` is actually executed. Now, let's dive into `src/libraries/Pool.sol` to understand how token swaps occur within the contract.

```solidity
struct SwapParams {
    int256 amountSpecified;
    int24 tickSpacing;
    bool zeroForOne;
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96;
    uint24 lpFeeOverride;
}
```
