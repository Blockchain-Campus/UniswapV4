# Pool Swap

In the previous section, we provided an overview of the entire swap process, but we have not yet analyzed how `pool.swap(params)` is actually executed. Now, let's dive into `src/libraries/Pool.sol` to understand how token swaps occur within the contract.

```solidity
struct SwapParams {
    int256 amountSpecified;
    int24 tickSpacing;
    bool zeroForOne;
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96;
    uint24 lpFeeOverride;
}

function swap(State storage self, SwapParams memory params)
        internal
        returns (BalanceDelta swapDelta, uint256 amountToProtocol, uint24 swapFee, SwapResult memory result)
    {
```

As seen in the code above, the `swap` function's input data structure is `SwapParams`. Let's analyze the role of each parameter in `SwapParams`. The `amountSpecified` parameter represents the exact amount of tokens the user wants to send to or receive from the pool.

`tickSpacing` determines the intervals at which ticks are searched (for example, 1, 10, or 20). Ticks can only be searched at increments defined by `tickSpacing`. Smaller `tickSpacing` values provide greater liquidity to complete the swap, resulting in more accurate transactions and reduced slippage. However, this comes at the cost of higher gas fees due to more extensive tick searches. 

It represents a trade-off between lower accuracy and higher slippage with reduced gas costs, or higher accuracy and lower slippage with increased gas costs.

`zeroForOne` indicates whether `token0` is being swapped for `token1` or the reverse.  

`sqrtPriceLimitX96` serves as price range protection, ensuring that swaps occur within a specified limit. This mechanism prevents slippage from exceeding the user's maximum allowable threshold.

`lpFeeOverride` works in conjunction with hooks to enable dynamic fees for swaps. If the hook overrides the liquidity provider (LP) fee before the swap is executed, the swap uses the overridden fee. Otherwise, the default swap fee is applied.
